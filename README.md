# typical-collatz
Just another Collatz Conjecture project

The purpose of this repository is to explore the structures formed by Collatz sequences to gain some insight into their behaviors.  
Investigation will make use of computation in Python 3.  
Nothing here is intended as a rigorous exploration of the conjecture itself.
